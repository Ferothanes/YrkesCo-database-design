- Developed a presentation explaining the data model and its benefits, including a video pitch. The presentation is saved as a PDF in the project repository.

### **Outcome:**
Efficient, secure, and scalable data management solution for multiple locations with future expansion capability. Demonstrates data modeling, SQL, and database design skills for portfolio purposes.
